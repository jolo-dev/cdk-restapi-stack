# Documentation

This package contains besides the OpenApi (Swagger) also the documentation about this project.

## OpenApi

The Lambdas are marked with an `@swagger` (it can also be `@openapi`) notation.
That is needed to create an `openapi.json` which is parsed by using the [`swagger-jsdoc`- library](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/).
